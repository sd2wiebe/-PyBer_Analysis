# -PyBer_Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose is to perform an exploratory analysis for python based ride sharing company, Pyber. I will be looking at how the type of city relates to the number of drivers and riders, as well as percentage of total riders, fares and drivers by type of city.
## Results

### Total Rides, Drivers and Fares by City Type

We can see from the data in the table:

that over our sample the least amount of rides, drivers, and fares occurred in a rural setting with 125, 78, and 4327.93$ respectively. In a suburban setting we saw an increase in rides, drivers and fares with 625, 490 and 19356.33$ respectively. In an urban setting we observed the most rides, drivers, and fares with 1625, 2405, and 39854.38$ respectively.

It is illustrated in this [line chart](https://github.com/sd2wiebe/-PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png) that the total fares by city type is dominated by urban cities.

### Average Fare per Ride and Driver by City Type

Referring to the table above, we can see that the highest average fare per driver, and average fare per ride, occurs in rural settings with 55.48$/driver and 34.62$/ride. In suburban cities we observed a lower average fare per driver, and average fare per ride, with 39.50$/driver and $30.97/ride. The lowest averages came in urban cities, with 16.57$/driver and 24.52$/ride 

## Summary

In conclusion the ride and fare total are where we expected them to be in regards to the city type. However, we did not expect the average fare per driver for urban cities to be less than half of that in suburban cities and less than a third of that in rural cities. This large disparity needs to be addressed. The significantly less fare/driver in urban cities is due to the very high amount of drivers, I would reccomend having less drivers in urban cities to bring that average closer to the suburban and rural numbers. I would also reccomend hiring more drivers in rural areas, as the average fare per driver is very high at 55.48$, so there is certainly room for more employees in these rural settings. A potential solution would be to have a portion of urban drivers relocate to rural cities where they will enjoy a higher fare/driver.
