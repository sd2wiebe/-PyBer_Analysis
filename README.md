that over our sample the least amount of rides, drivers, and fares occurred in a rural setting with 125, 78, and 4327.93$ respectively. In a suburban setting we saw an increase in rides, drivers and fares with 625, 490 and 19356.33$ respectively. In an urban setting we observed the most rides, drivers, and fares with 1625, 2405, and 39854.38$ respectively.`
