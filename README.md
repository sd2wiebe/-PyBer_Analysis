# -PyBer_Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose is to perform an exploratory analysis for python based ride sharing company, Pyber. I will be looking at how the type of city relates to the number of drivers and riders, as well as percentage of total riders, fares and drivers by type of city.
## Results

### Total Rides, Drivers and Fares by City Type

We can see from the data in the table:

</p>

that over our sample the least amount of rides, drivers, and fares occurred in a rural setting with 125, 78, and 4327.93$ respectively. In a suburban setting we saw an increase in rides, drivers and fares with 625, 490 and 19356.33$ respectively. In an urban setting we observed the most rides, drivers, and fares with 1625, 2405, and 39854.38$ respectively.

It is illustrated in this [line chart](https://github.com/sd2wiebe/-PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png) that the total fares by city type is dominated by urban cities.

</p>

Referring to the table above, we can see that the highest average fare per driver, and average fare per ride, occurs in rural settings with 55.48$/driver and 34.62$/ride. In suburban cities we observed a lower average fare per driver, and average fare per ride, with 39.50$/driver and $30.97/ride. The lowest averages came in urban cities, with 16.57$/driver and 24.52$/ride 


Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, 
describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
